Design specification 

------------------------------

1.-Agree on the purpose of the web site

The purpose of a theme park website is to show what type of attractions they offer, the infrastructure (e.g. restaurants and hotels) and sell tickets. Companies are expected to have an online site nowadays in order to reach more audiences at any time.

In general, the target audience could be families and tour agencies and they would be looking for deals and what type of theme park it is and its attractions. We can think of three main people who might visit the site:

 A- First time users. These kinds of people may look at our website looking for information like the different attractions in the park, the prices, promotions, pictures, or general information they are looking for to confirm their decision regarding visiting our park.
 
B- Recurrent users. These kinds of people already know about us. They already know about the attractions. They might be looking at our site in order to find promotions, events, or new features and attractions in our park.

C- Stakeholders like investors, employees or people interested in working at our company. These people might be interested in our mission, values, board of directors, or even vacancies.

-------------------------
 
2.-Research theme park web sites 

The different web pages for Lego Land are a good example where less is more. The simple design is easy to navigate, and combined with the great user experience design make it one of the favorites. We can clearly see that they have a menu as the heading, where you can see the logo, name and menu of the website. Then below it, We can see a picture of the main attractions. They also have a web page for promotions, and another for attractions description.
  https://www.legoland.com/
  
Six flags is mostly about roller coasters. One thing that could take the users away is that in their website the home page has too much information and many pictures and colors.

Universal Studios’ website is way better in the team's opinion. There’s some white space, a carousel with the attractions and the colors are more pleasant.

One thing needed to be considered is the grid with images that show the different parks within Disney World.
https://www.disneyworld.eu/

One example is the relatively simple and outdated look website in this link.
https://www.europapark.de/en

Phantasialand has the most distinct website among them. Although it is beautiful and has a modern look. It requires some clicks and scrolling in order to get to attractions, prices and other things that are relevant.

-------------------------------

3.-Agree on the content for the web site

Our park would be a Water Theme Park. There, we can offer different services that can be included in our web site.

*Main attractions

*Other small attractions and fun zones.

*Food service and restaurants

*Special promotions

*Money access through ATMs

*Health service

*Tour and travel agencies packages.

*Tickets services.

*Shows and team games.

*Stores and souvenir stalls.

----------------------------

4.-Agree on the structure of the web site
Our website could be a compound of three different pages. The website could be scalable in the future where we can include more pages after the analysis of the users interaction.

*Main Page

*Attractions Page

*Promotions and Tickets.


In our main webpage:

 We could design it using a layout or block design. In the header section, we can include a fixed top bar with a log in the LHS and links to the other two pages at the RHS.
In the content section, We could include a carousel of pictures with a Javascript code that changes the pictures to show different attractions.  We can include another section with cards of our three main attractions and services.

In the footer, we could include information like our schedule, opening hours, location, and links to future pages like: about us, policies, vacancies, investors.

In our attractions page:

We could have the same header with the same links. We can also repeat the footer.
For our content section, we could have an image related to the page content. Below it, we could add a list of the different attractions with information like name(with big and bolded text), category(with a different color and bolded text) and description with a normal text).

Promotions and Tickets:

We could have the same header and footer. For the content sections we will have the prices for general audiences, groups of people , kids. The format has to be in a centered block.

Below it, we could have a three block section with our three different promotions in holidays, or school days, or memberships.
If we need to add more promotions in the future we could add more three block sections.

5.-Design the wireframes for the web site
